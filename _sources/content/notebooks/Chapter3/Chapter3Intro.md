# Chapter 3 Additional Summary Statistics and Useful Concepts

In this section we consider a variety of techniques for detecting important nodes or subsets of nodes within a network. Such techniques are of great importance in biology (and other networks more generally) since they allow us to infer substructures of importance to the network of interest. Such substructures/nodes might, for example, provide potential drug targets, and/or highlight novel disease pathways that can help to better understand complex diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, etc.
