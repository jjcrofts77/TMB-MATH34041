        "After reading this section the reader will have a basic understanding of some of the mathematical prerequisites (i.e. graph theory) necessary to start studying the complex networks that arise in biology. However, due to time constraints many details have been omitted, for example, how does one go about computing the aforementioned metrics on the typically very large networks that result from biology? Clearly we can't perform matrix multiplications on a network with a million nodes! For this reason I have highlighted a number of books, papers and software packages below, that allows the interested reader (all of you!) to further explore this fascinating topic.\n",
