        "\n",
        "Alongside the characteristic path-length perhaps the most important network metric is that of clustering, which measures the extent to which a nodes neighbours are connected. A feature of highly clustered networks is the presence of a large number of triangles. For instance, in a friendship network it is highly likely that if Bob and Phil are both friends of Joe then they will eventually meet each other via their relation with Joe, thus forming a triangle. Mathematically, a highly clustered network, i.e. one in which  $i\\sim j$ and $i\\sim k$ implies a high probability that $j\\sim k$ is said to be *highly transitive*.\n",
