        "In real-world networks nodes often cluster together in such a way that groups are formed in which nodes are densely connected with each other but very sparsely connected with the rest of the network. Such groups are typically referred to as *communities* or *modules* (with module being more popular in the biological community - no pun intended!). For example, in {numref}`metabolicexample` we display the metabolic network of *E. coli*, colour coded to highlight the different modules - note that these modules are strongly related to specific metabolic pathways such as glycolysis.  In this section we shall take a brief look at just how to determine the type of modular structure present in the network in {numref}`metabolicexample`.\n",

        "Girvan and Newman (GN) proposed *modularity* as a network measure for determining community structure. The idea is to automate the detection of groups of nodes such as those highlighted in {numref}`metabolicexample`. That is, to determine a partitioning of the node set $V$, i.e. a collection of sets $V_i\\subset V$ such that $V_i\\cap V_j = \\emptyset$ $\\forall i\\neq j$ and such that $\\cup_i V_i = V$, such that nodes in the same set are densely connected with each other, but sparsely connected with all other nodes. To measure the \"quality\" of such a partition GN forwarded the following modularity score\n",
