        "\n",
        "Network traversal refers to the process of visiting (potentially examining and/or updating) the nodes in a network. Integral to network traversal is the concept of a *walk* which provides information on indirect connections within the network (in contrast the adjacency matrix or network structure highlights direct connections). A walk of length $k$ is simply a series of edges $(v_{i_1}, v_{i_2}), (v_{i_2}, v_{i_3}),\\ldots (v_{i_k},v_{i_{k+1}})$, that is, any traversal of the network that follows $k$ edges. If $v_{i_1}=v_{i_{k+1}}$ then the walk is said to be closed. A \\emph{trail} is a walk in which all edges are distinct. A *path* is a trail in which all nodes are distinct. A closed path is called a *cycle* or *circuit*. Finally, a cycle of length 3 is called a *triangle*. Note that a network with no cycles is called a *tree*.\n",

The maximum value of the distance function in a connected network $N$ is called the *diameter* of $N$.\n",
