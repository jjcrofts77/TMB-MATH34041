        "The spectrum of a network will refer to the spectrum of the adjacency matrix in this course. Importantly, the spectrum is what is known as a `graph invariant', in that it does not depend upon how the network is labelled. To see this, let $P$ denote a permutation matrix - relabelling the nodes is equivalent to permuting the rows and columns of the adjacency matrix - then we have that\n",
