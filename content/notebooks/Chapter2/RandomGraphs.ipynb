        "The most commonly employed null model is that of the Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi (ER) random graph, which we denote as $G(n,p)$\\footnote{Strictly speaking this is the Gilbert model but it is typically referred to as the ER model; the two are equivalent for large $n$.}. To construct an ER Random graph we start with a set of $n$ isolated nodes and connect node pairs independently with some prespecified probability $p>0$ -- in practice we assign to each pair of nodes a random number $r\\in[0,1]$ and place a link between node pairs if $p>r$. See Figure \\ref{fig:ERexamples} for an illustration of a number of ER networks for $n=20$ nodes and a variety of $p$ values.\n",
