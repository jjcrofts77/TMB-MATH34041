# Chapter 2 Network Models

Network models play an important role in network analysis for a number of reasons.

1. They are interesting to study in their own right and can be made increasingly complicated thus more closely reflecting real-world networks.
2. They provide null models against which we can compare real-world networks of interest -- a bit like how we use the normal distribution in statistics to determine significance (ask Golnaz!).
3. We can employ them as `substrates' on which to run dynamical systems in order to model phenomena such as synchrony in a controlled environment.

In the following we  restrict ourselves to some of the most important network models to date - of which  there are many!
