        "Determining the mechanisms underlying observed topological structures in biology is of great importance since they provide clues regarding the evolutionary processes that helped shape them. Next, we study one of the first such models: the \\emph{Barab\\'asi-Albert (BA) model}. \n",

        "Unlike the WS model that generates small-world networks, the BA model was developed to generate networks with power law degree distributions. To initiate the BA algorithm we start with a small network containing $n_0$ nodes and $m_0$ edges. At each iterate of the algorithm we add a new node $u$ and connect it to existing nodes with a probability proportional to their degrees. Thus we are more likely to attach new nodes to existing nodes of high degree. For this reason the model is often referred to as the \\emph{preferential attachment model}. Figure \\ref{fig:BAmodel} illustrates the process starting from a simple network on 3 nodes.\n",
