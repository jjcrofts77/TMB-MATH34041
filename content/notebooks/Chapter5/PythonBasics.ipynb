For this course the recommended IS is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), which is free to use and ships with [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) a scientific Python development environment (see Figure {numref}`FigSpyderIDE3` for an example of the Spyder environment).\n",

        "To create a Python script we enter commands into the editor, save our progam and run it by clicking on the green triangle in the upper-lefthand corner of the IDE; the results will displayed in the Python console in the lower-righthand pane of the IDE.
